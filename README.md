# TGS-Salt-Identification-Challenge
 Segment salt deposits beneath the Earth's surface
* Tree notebook is an investigation whether segmentation is possible by extracting geophysical features and model them by linear models, such as trees. I tried to test if can classify the lithology according to the amplitude of the sample/pixel and by analyzing the data in the vertical axis only.
* CNN_new is an investigation whether it is possible to extract features from the image by lateral relationships. Can I do some first manipulations with AutoEncoders to better extract lithologies?
